As a workflow software, Parsl provides users the ability to define complex workflows in simple python to be executed in parallel on any computer system.
One useful feature that Parsl lacked was convenient workflow monitoring.
This project set out to add workflow monitoring to Parsl as to enhance its feature set.
Simple and comprehensive monitoring of a workflows state and resource usage provides users value by allowing auditing, debugging, and confirmation of workflow execution.
The paper discusses the components of workflows that are monitored by Parsl, the strategy for capturing these components, and the tools used to accumulate and display these components.
Primarily, this project used python libraries to collect task status and resource usage and log these tasks to an Elasticsearch database.
A Kibana dashboard was then created to visualize the collected logs in a real time and interactive user interface (UI).
In the end, the newer versions of Parsl will allow users the option to monitor the status and resource usage of their workflows via an Elasticsearch database and Kibana dashboard.
