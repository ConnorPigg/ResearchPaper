The solution was created according to a simple strategy.
First, from the inside Parsl source log information.
Second, store these logs to a central location that a user can access.
Finally, present these logs in a dashboard accessible to a user.

The particular source logging implementation uses the python logging handler CMRESHandler.
The choice for central log storage was an Elasticsearch instance.
Finally, a Kibana instance and dashboard was chosen for the UI.
The benefits of these options are that they allowed simple solution development and provided the core functionality out of the box.
The downsides of these options are that they are not trivial to distribute to users and can be rigid in the available customizations.

The solution was developed by iteratively adding logging statements to the code and then crafting visuals for the new information.
This was an efficient way to increase presented information while keeping each addition simple.
